# joggingApplication
iOS Jogging Application that calculates and displays calories burned, distance travelled, duration 
This is still on-going project and code is not refactored yet.
As the user inputs weights on more tab and records the trip, it calculates the calories burned, distance travelled, duration.
After recording a trip, the route of the trip will be drawn on Google Map.
Blue lines on a map represent the locations where the speed is over 2 m/s.
Brown dots on a map represent the locations where the speed is 0 m/s.
Otherwise, the route of the trip will be drawn in black colour.
